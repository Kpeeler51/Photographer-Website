# Photography website

Designed by Kyle Peeler

## Overview

My first coding project: A portfolio and
commissioning website for a photographer. Used to learn the functions and fundamentals
of web development.

## Details

Contains a working navbar with all pages of the website, Working social media links in the
about page, and a working form in the contact page powered by <formspree.io>.

Navbar and carousel provided by Bootstrap recolored using custom css in the css/style.css file.
Gallery, prices, and contact pages formatted using Bootstrap rows and columns.

## Usage

Source code hosted at: <https://github.com/Kpeeler51/Photographer-Website>

Github Pages website hosted at: <https://kpeeler51.github.io/Photographer-Website/>

All pages of the website can be accessed by clicking the navbar.
Contact form can be used by typing information into the text boxes. Email address and phone number do not need to be real, only formatted correctly in the style of a email address and phone number respectively.

## Technologies used

HTML5,  CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3.3

## Future improvements

Improve website responsiveness and function on smaller screens and mobile devices.

An admin interface so the photographer may update or add to their gallery and prices.

Better usage of semantic/generic elements like divs and sections.
